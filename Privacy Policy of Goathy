Privacy Policy for Goathy The Chatbot

Last updated: January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Goathy The Chatbot ("the Bot") handles user data within Discord.

1. Data Collection and Processing

Goathy The Chatbot does not collect or store personal data by default.

The Bot processes Discord messages temporarily only to provide its core functionality. Messages are not stored permanently, logged, or shared with third parties unless explicitly required by a user-initiated action.

2. User-Initiated Contact with the Developer

The Bot provides a special command that allows users to send a message directly to the developer.

When a user voluntarily uses this command, they explicitly consent to the following:
- The content of the message being forwarded to the developer
- Their Discord User ID being visible to the developer
- The developer being able to respond to the user via Discord

This data is used solely for communication and support purposes and is not shared with any third parties.

3. Data Retention

Messages sent through the contact command and associated User IDs may be retained temporarily by the developer for the purpose of responding to the user or resolving issues. The data is not used for analytics, profiling, advertising, or tracking.

4. Data Sharing

The Bot does not sell, trade, or share user data with third parties. Data is only accessible to the developer when explicitly provided by the user through a consent-based command.

5. User Rights

Users may choose not to use the contact command if they do not wish to share their User ID or message with the developer.

If a user wishes to request deletion of a previously sent message, they may contact the developer directly.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.

7. Contact

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact the developer via Discord.

By using Goathy The Chatbot, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
